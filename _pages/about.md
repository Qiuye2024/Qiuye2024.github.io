I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC). I received my Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma (OU) in 2024 under the supervision of Dr. Song Fang, my M.Eng. degree from Xidian University in 2019, and my B.Eng. degree from Yanshan University in 2016.

<font color='red'> I am looking for self-motivated students who are interested in Cybersecurity and Mobile Computing & Sensing! Multiple Ph.D. openings are available in our group. Please feel free to contact me at *qiuye.he AT umkc.edu*.</font>
